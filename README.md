# TicTacToe

This program is a 2-player game of TicTacToe that is displayed entirely using Java's Swing framework for graphical user interfaces. It is my first project involving GUIs and is
somewhat messy, which leaves room for potential improvement later on. The initial screen of the program is displayed as such:

Where player 1 controls the spaces marked with "X" and player 2 controls the spaces marked with "O". Both players each have their own respective color scheme that will border the
spots that they take up on the board, with player 1 having a red border and player 2 having a blue one. Once either player is able to take three spots in a row, the program
will display that the respective player has won, all the remaining spots on the board will be disabled, and the users will be prompted if they want a rematch:

## Code Structure
The Board class maintains all real values of the board and checks for win conditions.
[to-do]

## To-Do List
- Formatting is slightly out of place. I plan to have the GUI formatted in rows instead of columns, and have the panels spaced out so the interface isn't so claustrophobic.
- More comprehensive logos, images.
